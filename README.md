## Prebuilt jars ‚òï
The prebuilt jars are in the [releases section](https://github.com/OpenCraftStudios/LWJGL-Edition/releases).
Although you will need a launcher to play the game because it needs of libraries.

*By the way, those libraries are open-source and free, so you can download them easily.*

If you don't want to use a launcher, you can execute it manually. Only **follow these steps**

**Windows**
```batch
java -cp OpenCraft.jar;libraries.jar; net.opencraft.OpenCraft --gameDir opcraft
```

**Bash**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
java -cp OpenCraft.jar:libraries.jar: net.opencraft.OpenCraft --gameDir opcraft/
```
