# Contributing :heart:
We are a small community so we need help to implement upgrades for new OpenCraft versions, fixing bugs and expanding the project.
We are always looking for motivated people to contribute. If you feel like it could be you, make sure these steps:
 - Select the type of download that you want:
    - [Beta version](https://github.com/OpenCraft-Studios/LWJGL-Edition/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
    - [Stable version](https://github.com/OpenCraft-Studios/LWJGL-Edition/releases/latest)
 - Download a Java IDE:
   - [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) (Light-weight, but for **experienced** programmers)
   - [Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html) (Heavy, for amateurs)
   - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) (For beginners!)
